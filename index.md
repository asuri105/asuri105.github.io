## About Me

My name is Arunima Suri, and I am a rising sophomore at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I plan on graduating in May of 2024 with a dual degree in Computer Science and Education. My main research interests revolve around Education Technology and Computer Science Education. My email address is arunima@suri.org.  

## About My Mentor

[Dr. Susan H. Rodger](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/rodger) is the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Computer Science and a Professor of the Practice of Computer Science in the Trinity College of Arts & Sciences at Duke Univeristy. Her area of research focus is Computer Science education, and she has many external relationships surrounding this field, including the Computing Research Association, Coursera, IBM, and ACM SIGCSE. A more comprehensive list of her current work can be found [here](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~rodger/). 

## About My Project

My research project this summer focuses on creating autograders for open-ended assigments for an introductory python course on Coursera. Part of this work includes doing an extensive literature review on autograders and open-ended assignments to understand what types of systems already exist; however, open-ended assignments in general are known to be a new concept in computer science education. In terms of the autograders themselves, they are written in python, using the testing framework, pytest, for supplementary functionality. Concurrent with this work, I am also taking an introductory research course, UR2PhD, to help strengthen my understanding of the research process.
