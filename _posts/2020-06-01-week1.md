title: Week 1
---

The first week was all about getting acclimated to the project details, including the process of building the autograders, learning how to read research papers, and starting the online research course. I first spent some time learning about pytest, the python testing library, as that is the foundation from which all the autograders are built. I also read through the documentation that already exists for writing autograders in this project and learned how the Coursera environment works as a development tool. From there, I was able to start working on my first open-ended autograder for an assignment about user input and randomness, and I began by writing out a significant number of incorrect student solutions that could be used to test the validity of the autograder itself. I ended the week working on writing the different test cases for each buggy solution. Side by side with this autograder work, I read some papers on how to actually read a research paper and then read a couple of research papers about autograders and open-ended assignments for introductory CS classes to be able to get a better understanding of the context behind this research. The research course I am taking also began with introductory lessons about research culture and working collaboratively in a research team.
