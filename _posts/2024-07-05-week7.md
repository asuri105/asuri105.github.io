title: Week 7
---

My week was spent working the course 2 autograder that I started last week that had multiple student solution files. My mentors decided it would be best to split the assignment into three mini autograders, which made my work a lot more straightforward. I was able to write all three autograders and submit them for peer review. In addition, I spent a decent amount of time working on updating my old autograders based on code review feedback from my mentors. Finally, I also worked on starting an outline for the motivation, introduction, research question, related work, and methods section of the manuscript I will be writing for this research project.
