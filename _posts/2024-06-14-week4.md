title: Week 4
---

This week was focused on creating autograders and wrapping up the UR2PhD research course I have been taking for the past 4 weeks. In terms of autograders, we finished up our group autograder for a debugging lab and then I was also able to build an autograder for a lab based on the accumulator pattern. While working on my solo autograder, I took some time to learn about regular expressions and how to implement them in python so that I could improve efficieny in many of my autograder test cases. For the research class, we finished writing our [research proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dH3VuL6m7FQyZuYC1SmrftsGSCE4N-ml/view?usp=sharing) for our summer project, conducted a peer review with other research groups in the course, created and recorded a final presentation, and completed a few reflection activities during this week.
