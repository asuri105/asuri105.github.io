title: Week 8
---

As I am nearing the end of my research program, a lot more of my work has been focused on refining and improving previous autograders I have written, as well as helping my fellow undergrad researchers do the same. I made changes to multiple autograders based on feedback I received from my mentors and peers, and I also completed a few code reviews for my peers. In regards to my research manuscript, I used the feedback I got from my mentors to make updates to my outline and continued working on my methodology section. This included looking into different types of validated instruments I could use for survey data as well as skimming research papers to see how the authors approached collecting data for MOOCs. At the end of the week, I picked up another autograder related to lists that will likely be my final one as I only have two more weeks before I conclude my program.
