title: Week 9

I spent most of this week working on my final autograder for an assignment that mimickes the process of making a temperature blanket using a variety of functions. The autograder work for this assignment was a lot more complex and time-consuming because of the multi-file student submissions, the plentiful number of student functions, and the need to mock multiple different built in functions using pyest. While working on this autograder, I also continued to improve upon my previous autograders from earlier in the summer, being able to push two more of them into the main branch by the end of the week. In addition, I was able to get feedback on the methods section I formulated for my research question and then started working on actually writing out the first few sections of my manuscript as my final product for the end of my summer program.
