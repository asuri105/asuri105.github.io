During the week, my autograder work shifted focus as I moved onto autograders for lab assignments in Course 2 of the Coursera course, in which students start learning about functions. With this shift, I spent time learning more about pytest and unit test functionality, including parameterization and mocking. The autograder I started working on is for a function based quiz generator assignment, and I was able to write the sample student solutions, the starter learner file, and many of the assignments' tests. In terms of the literature review aspect of my work, we started transitioning into the next step of the process, which is formulating research questions we can ask related to the autograders and open-ended assignments. This includes thinking about what kinds of data we would collect for each question. And with this, the end of this week marked the halfway point in my research project
